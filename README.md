# CS50P – Harvard’s Introduction to Programming with Python 🐍

Welcome to my repository for CS50’s **Introduction to Programming with Python**, offered by Harvard University through edX.

This repo contains all my solutions and notes for the **problem sets (psets)** provided in the course. I’ve documented everything carefully as a personal learning journey and to help others navigate the course.

## 📂 Structure

Each folder corresponds to a problem set and contains:

- ✅ Python code files (`.py`)
- 📝 README (if needed per pset)
- 🧪 Tested using CS50's `check50` and `submit50`
